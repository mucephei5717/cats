      <td>🗿Fighting</td>
      <td>Cats are territorial animals and they will often <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlsurQZ-Ufc">fight</a> to defend what they believe is their territory. This is most common with cat fights that happen outside the house, where your cat believes another cat has encroached on their land. Alternately, a feral cat could believe your cat should not be here. But such fighting is also common among cats who live together. Cats mark their territories with scent, and your house is no exception.</td>

<td>🐾Climbing Walls</td>
<td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruMn_8p9qmk">Climbing</a> to a place of height allows them to observe their habitat better, even if this habitat is our home. In the wild, being up high allows them to both observe prey to hunt and watch out for predators to avoid being hunted. In the home, being off the floor allows them to avoid tripping over people and generally being away from the hubbub of a household. Many cats in the wild are considered (at least partly) arboreal. Climbing up trees allows them to stay somewhere safe, something particularly helpful when sleeping</td>

<td>💤Sleeping</td>
<td>On average, throughout a 24-hour period, cats <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psGDf2VrvK8">sleep</a> for about 79 out of every 104 minutes4. Unlike humans, who tend to sleep in one long time period at night, cats have a polyphasic sleep schedule that is marked by multiple shorter bouts of sleep across both day and night. In general, cats tend to be more active at night5 and sleep more during the day. Male and female cats do not appear to need different amounts of sleep.</td>
